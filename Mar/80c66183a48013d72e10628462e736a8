The governorship ambition of Labour Party (LP) candidate, Dr. Alex Otti, received its biggest boost yet on Tuesday when the former Minister of State, Mines, Dr. Uche Ogah, delivered a formidable structure in support of Otti. Ogah, a stalwart of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and former governorship aspirant, yielded his political structure, Abia Rejoice, to Otti, most favoured to win the Saturday, March 11 governorship election in Abia. Ogah, who spoke through the Director General of the Uche Ogah Campaign Organisation, Hon Chibuzo Okogbue, described Otti as the best candidate out of the lot that have filed out for the governorship of Abia State. According to Okogbue, members of the Abia Rejoice after a thorough scrutiny of all the gubernatorial candidates, have resolved to work with the Alex Otti Campaign Organisation in order to realise the LP candidateâ€™s ambition to reclaim Abia from the stranglehold of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Otti expressed his gratitude to Ogah and the Abia Rejoice group for the honour of their endorsement and adoption as the preferred governorship candidate. He pleaded with the group which gathered at Binez Hotel, off Aba-Owerri Road, Aba, to having adopted him also adopt all the Labour Party House of Assembly candidates for the state constituency election.
