The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) says it has begun investigation into the alleged maltreatment of over Nigeria-bound passengers by German carrier, Lufthansa Airlines Mr Sam Adurogboye, the General Manager, Public Affairs, NCAA, who made the disclosure in Lagos, said the agency had got a report of the alleged maltreatment of over 200 Nigeria-bound passengers. A Frankfurt-Lagos flight, meant to arrive the Murtala Muhammed International Airport at 5:45pm last Friday, later arrived at 2am after diverting to Cotonou in Republic of Benin and Malabo, Equitorial Guinea. The aircraft had hovered over Lagos airport for one hour before leaving for Cotonou. On arriving Lagos at 2am, the passengers asked the airline to make arrangement for their stay but the carrier reportedly threatened to call police on them. There were also reports that Lagos airport was not closed contrary to the claim by the Lufthansa pilot. Adurogboye said the report had got to the aviation industry regulator and an investigation has been launched into the matter. He said, ‘”I just got our Consumer Department and I was told that the report came in today and, as such, just beginning to do their investigation into the matter.”
