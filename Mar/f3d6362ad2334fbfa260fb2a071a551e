Dr. Alex Otti, Labour Party governorship candidate in Abia State, has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to redeem its image by sorting out any issues with the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) before the March 18 governorship and state assembly elections. The electoral body has faced intense criticism over the failure of BVAS to transmit results of the February 25 presidential election from polling units. Dr. Otti who spoke on his chances of winning the Abia governorship poll during a live appearance on Channels Television’s Politics Today on Thursday, said he still believes BVAS is a game changer but asked INEC to fix the problem with the devices. “Despite the discussions about BVAS and all that, I still believe BVAS is a game changer and I believe that something must have gone wrong and it has to be fixed. INEC needs to redeem its image because a lot of us were very hopeful and excited that votes would count this time,” he said. “I followed the election in Ekiti and Osun, what happened on the 25th is not a representation of what happened in Ekiti and Osun. So, my plea is that INEC should solve the problem before the election of March 18,” Otti said. The Labour Party flag bearer in Abia stated that, if elected, he would embark on massive rebuilding of infrastructure that would help in reducing unemployment and creating jobs for the people of the state.
