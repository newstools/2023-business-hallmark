Laide Bakare, a Nollywood actress, has denied a purported WhatsApp status screenshot credited to her, wherein she allegedly threatened to expose her colleague, Iyabo Ojo. The said WhatsApp status shared by blogger Gistlover read, “This year make everybody dey their lane. And if you want wahala let’s drag ourselves from status to instagram. I av d message u sent to MC Sept 15th Mtcheeew.” Reacting to the circulating screenshot, Bakare on her Instagram page on Wednesday night said, “Disclaimer! Disclaimer!! Why? Why? Why? Please guys disregard #laidebakare and #iyaboojofespris saga. It’s staged by the evil doers to instigate.” According to her, “My attention has been drawn to a sad disturbing trending news today about me and my friend and colleague #iyaboojofespris. “It actually beats my imagination how far people can go in this life to tarnish one’s image and create wahala where there’s none. “Whoever doctored my status and used my name to want to course chaos between us, has just displayed the highest level of wickedness. “How can you go that far? Gosh, this beats my imagination. I’m far away and I’ve been so busy not even knowing what’s going on and now this? “Haaaaa aye ma ni ka ooo. Whose so ever beyond this, I won’t insult you but rather I leave you to God. “For the record, lyabo is my friend and colleague for so many years and I have never had issues with her even if at all, I have my phone to call her and we discuss. This is just too much for whoever did this. God is watching you.” Credit: Instagram | laidebakare
