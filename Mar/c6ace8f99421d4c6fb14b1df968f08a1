Seplat Energy Plc has thrown its weight behind Roger Brown, its CEO amid allegations of racism against him. Brown is alleged to have been favouring foreign workers, and discriminating against Nigerian employees. The Federal Government had revoked Brown’s visa due to several allegations made against him by the workers. It was also disclosed that Brown discriminates against Nigerian workers and flouted the Expatriate Quota by having a Combined Expatriate Residence Permit and Aliens Card (CERPAC). However, in a statement signed by Seplat’s chairman, Basil Omiyi, on Thursday, the company described the allegations as false and passed a vote of confidence in the CEO. The statement further noted that company’s CEO, Brown, will discharge his duties from Seplat United Kingdom (UK) office. The statement reads: “Seplat Energy Plc has become aware of a news report following a letter regarding the residency status of its Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Mr. Roger Brown. “Seplat Energy wishes to refute the false allegations against Mr. Brown, which have been presented to the Ministry of Interior and the public by certain petitioners, and which have not been brought to the attention of Mr. Roger Brown or Seplat Energy for a reaction. “Seplat Energy will be engaging with the Ministry to reject the impressions created by these allegations. “The Board believes that these allegations are a spurious and vindictive reaction to the enforcement of corporate governance standards in the Company by the Board of Seplat Energy. “Over the past decade, Mr. Brown has earned an unblemished record of service and leadership in the Company. On 8th March 2023, the Board of Seplat Energy unanimously passed a vote of confidence in Mr. Brown, who continues to discharge his duties and responsibilities as CEO from the SEPLAT UK office.”
