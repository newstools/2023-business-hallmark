The Alumni Association of the Lagos State University of Science and Technology (LASUSTECH) formerly known as Lagos State Polytechnic Alumni Association is desirous of having Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu return as the Governor of Lagos State in the forthcoming gubernatorial elections of March 18, 2023 so as to have him commission the iconic gate house donated to the institution by the Alumni Association. The President of the Association, Dr ‘Yinka Adewusi, while briefing pressmen during an interactive session, revealed that the Association deeply connected with the vision of Mr. Governor in transmuting the institution from a Polytechnic to a University. He was full of praises for the Governor as he noted with special interest that while other similar institutions with similar intentions in other States, including some Federal institutions, are still struggling with the process for years, Mr. Governor led from the front to achieve this relatively difficult feat in record time. Dr. Adewusi who saluted the uncommon passion with which the Lagos State Government drove the process through, informed that the past students were motivated to create a global branding for the institution by donating the iconic gate house which is tentatively scheduled to be commissioned by the Governor in July, 2023. According to Dr. Adewusi, the ₦50.0million project is a philanthropic support to the institution and the Lagos State Government. He, once again, commended Governor Babajide Olushola Sanwo-Olu for the superb administrative courage and wisdom with which he seamlessly transmuted the institution and concluded that the least the Association can do is to support this rare commitment to a noble cause such as demonstrated by Mr. Governor.
