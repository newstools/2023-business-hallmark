Joseph Maigari, the Northeast zonal coordinator of the Obi-Datti presidential campaign council, has alleged votes secured by Peter Obi, Labour Party presidential candidate in the state during the presidential election on Saturday were counted for other parties. Maigari who spoke at a press conference on Thursday in Abuja maintained that the presidential election was rigged and called on the party supporters to remain calm. “Most of the votes for LP were counted for other political parties, especially in Adamawa, which we are not happy [with] and we have the evidence to present,” he said. In the presidential poll, Adamawa was won by Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He secured 417, 611 votes to defeat Tinubu who had 182,881 votes and Obi who polled 105,648 votes. Atiku is a native of Adamawa state, where he was elected governor in 1998 before becoming the running mate of former President Olusegun Obasanjo. On his part, Christopher Nicolas, the chairman of Labour Party in the state criticised Umaru Mustapha, governorship candidate of the party in the state for allegedly asking supporters to vote for Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the presidential election. He said prior to the election, Mustapha asked his supporters to vote for the APC standard bearer. “On behalf of our president, national chairman, we thank our supporters for the votes given to us, we appreciate you all,” NAN quoted Nicolas as saying. “We equally encourage you to vote for candidates contesting for state assembly under our great party. “While for governorship, we are working on it because he came out publicly and denounced our boss, and called his supporters to vote for APC which is an offence for us.”
