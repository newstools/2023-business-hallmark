Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has confirmed it will cut 10,000 jobs in coming months, after laying off 11,000 in December. The Chief Executive Officer of Meta, Mark Zuckerberg, announced this via his Facebook page on Tuesday, “Here’s the timeline you should expect. Over the next couple of months, org leaders will announce restructuring plans focused on flattening our orgs, cancelling lower priority projects, and reducing our hiring rates,” he wrote. “Overall, we expect to reduce our team size by around 10,000 people and to close around 5,000 additional open roles that we haven’t yet hired. “This will be tough, and there’s no way around that. It will mean saying goodbye to talented and passionate colleagues who have been part of our success. They are part of a wider strategy to make the company more ‘efficient and lean.”
