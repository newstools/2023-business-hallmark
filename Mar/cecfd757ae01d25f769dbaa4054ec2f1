The Labour Party (LP) in Taraba State has denied endorsing the governorship candidate of the peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Col. Kefas Agbu. Mrs. Esther Gulmu, state chairperson of the party who made the disclaimer in a press briefing in Jalingo on Friday, said the action was the handiwork of mischief makers who are out to tannish the image of the party in the state. Evangelist Philip Mulip, a member of labour party in Taraba had on Wednesday led some group of people and addressed a press conference, presented himself as the governorship candidate of the party and endorsed col. Kefas Agbu the PDP governorship candidate. Mulip told journalist that he as a governorship candidate of labour party in Taraba, was collapsing the party structures for the PDP governorship candidate. However, Mrs. Gulmu while reacting to the publication, decried that Evangelist Philip was not the party’s governorship candidate neither candidate for any position in the 2023 general election. “Our governorship candidate is senator Joel Ikenya and not Evangelist Philip Mulip. We have not endorse any candidate, we are still in the race,” she said. “The action of Evangelist Mulip is condemnable. He is desperate and want to tannish the good image of our party party and her candidates. “We wish to urge the good people of Taraba state to disregard the purported endorsement and keep their faith and full support for Labour party to take over Taraba” The chairperson denied.
