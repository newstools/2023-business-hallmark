President Buhari has appointed the Managing Director of Access Bank Plc, Roosevelt Ogbonna to the Advisory Council on Support to Women and Girls. This appointment is as a result of Access Bank’s dedication to women’s empowerment through adequate financing and literacy promotion, as well as advocacy and specialised training. Commenting on the recent development, Ogbonna stated thus: “This achievement signifies a significant responsibility to ensure gender equality, equal access to opportunities, and national development through purposeful long-term initiatives targeted at women.” “Indeed, every individual, irrespective of status, organisation, or tribe, has a part to play in ensuring the rights of women and girls are upheld. As we enter the month of the woman, we must recognise that gender equality is a fundamental human right and a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable nation.”
