Peter Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party has said he will not call to congratulate Bola Tinubu who was declared winner of Saturday’s presidential election because he didn’t deserve to win. Obi stated this while fielding questions from journalists during his press conference in Abuja on Thursday. The former Anambra State governor said he is going to court to challenge the outcome of the election because he has evidence that he won. “I’ll bring all my proofs to court. I’m not in alliance with any party. I was once awarded a Prof by a school but I turned it down bcos it is wrong and unethical to accept what you don’t deserve. I wrote to the university and said, no I won’t accept it because I have not gone through the process. I will not call to congratulate him bcos he doesn’t deserve the win.” Obi, however, noted that Tinubu is his elder brother, and he would always see him whenever he wants him to see him. “Tinubu is my elder brother. In fact, he’s even like a father. If he wants me to see him, I will see him. But I will not call anybody. I will challenge the process in court for the future of this country, and for the future of the children of those judiciary officers.”
