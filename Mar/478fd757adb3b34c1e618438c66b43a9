The All Progressives Congress (APC) national welfare secretary, Friday Nwosu, is dead. The ruling party which announced his demise in a tweet on Thursday night, said he passed on at a hospital in the federal capital territory (FCT). “Words are not enough to describe the monumental loss brought by the passing of the party’s National Welfare Secretary, Sir Friday Nwanozie Nwosu on the APC family. May his soul rest in peace,” the party tweeted. In the build-up to the 2019 general election, Nwosu was a governorship aspirant in Abia state on the platform of the APC. Before joining the ruling party, he contested the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship ticket with Okezie Ikpeazu, the incumbent governor of Abia pre-2015.
