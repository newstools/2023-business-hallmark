Regina Daniels, Nollywood actress and producer, has warned that the movie industry is not a place for young girls, while urging producers to discourage the act of employing minors. Daniels, wife of Ned Nwoko, a billionaire businessman and politician, gave the advice on her Instagram page on Monday where she advised celebrities, and movie producers, to say no to child labour and keep the industry secure. “I met a 14-year-old girl wearing a short skirt, crop-top and working under another young guy on the movie set who claims to be a make-up artist. Her parents are far away in Port Harcourt and she came to Lagos last year,” she said. “She sleeps in different hotel rooms with whoever agrees to accommodate her every night and is not willing to go back to her parents. This girl told me that she is here to learn but trust me, I know the industry and it is not a safe place for young girls.” Credit: Instagram | regina.daniels
