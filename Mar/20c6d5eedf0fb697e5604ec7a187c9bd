But while the APC has started victory party, tension is building across the country amid allegations of widespread manipulation of the election. Crucially, despite assurances, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) failed to transmit results from polling units on election day, which created rooms for suspicion. In places like Rivers, Lagos, Akwa Ibom, Ebonyi, Imo among several states of the federation, there are pictorial evidences of rewritten results, and videos evidences of electoral officers changing results, even as thugs ran rampage in some states. The leading political parties, including the Labour Party, PDP and NNPP, among others, have since rejected the results, accusing INEC of fraud.
