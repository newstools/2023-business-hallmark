The Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has postponed the 2023 Mock-UTME earlier scheduled for Thursday, March 16, 2023, to Thursday, March 30, 2023. The shift in date is partly owing to the change in the date for the Governorship and State Houses of Assembly Elections earlier scheduled to hold on Saturday, March 11, 2023, but now moved to March 18, 2023, the examination board said in a statement on Monday afternoon. “Candidates, who registered early and indicated their willingness to take the Mock-UTME, would be notified as to when to print their Mock-UTME notification slip, which would contain their centres and other details”. The mock UTME is an optional examination introduced by the JAMB to provide an opportunity for candidates to have hands-on experience with the system as well as afford the board an opportunity to ascertain its readiness and that of its partners for the main UTME, which is scheduled to hold between April 29 to May 12, 2023.
