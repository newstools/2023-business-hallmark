Tottenham Hotspur manager, Antonio Conte, has admitted that he could be dismissed by club after his team’s Champions League exit. Spurs have lost seven of their 15 games in 2023 and their trophy hopes have been vanquished, with a top-four finish in the Premier League their last remaining target. They hold down fourth place at the moment, but Liverpool and Newcastle United are in close pursuit. The European campaign ended with a 1-0 loss on aggregate to Milan at the last-16 stage, after a bleak 0-0 draw at home on Wednesday in which Tottenham barely threatened their visitors, managing just two shots on target. The Italian was appointed in November 2021 on a contract that runs through the end of this season. Conte told Italian broadcaster Prime: “I respect the contract and at the end of the season I’ll make the right assessments with the club. “Let’s see, maybe they can send me away even earlier. For a coach, what matters is raising the bar, and we struggled this year.” Tottenham hosts Nottingham Forest in the Premier League on Saturday.
