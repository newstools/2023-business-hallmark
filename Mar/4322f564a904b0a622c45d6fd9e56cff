The Lagos State government has begun the release of impounded vehicles to their owners, free of charge. This, it said, is on account of the cash crunch that has hit the nation as a result of Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN’s) Naira redesign policy. Dr. Frederic Oladeinde, Transportation Commissioner said in an interview on Tuesday that Governor Sanwo-Olu extended the measure by ensuring that vehicles impounded for minor traffic offences were released to their owners with the fines waived. “When you look at what the governor proposed, especially during the cash crunch, we have reduced public transport fare by 50 per cent. So, when you board our BRTs and all Lagos State-funded public transport, including Lag Ride, we have reduced the fare by 50 per cent just to alleviate the suffering of our people,” he said. “Besides, we have opened food banks in certain areas. We’re beginning to give out palliatives to ensure people survive in this cash crunch period.”
