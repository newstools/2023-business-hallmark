Nigerian-American National Football League (NFL) player, Uche Nwaneri, is dead. The announcement about Nwaneri’s demise was made on Monday by his former team Jacksonville Jaguars, whom he played seven seasons for as an offensive lineman. Reports said Nwaneri died at his wife’s home in West Lafayette, Indiana, in the U.S. on Friday. His lifeless body was found in the bedroom by his wife, who then called for help. Tippecanoe County Coroner, Carrie Costello, said initial investigations showed no sign of foul play and that the preliminary investigation determined that Nwaneri died of a possible heart attack. The NFL community has since been paying tribute to the deceased, who was only 38 years old. Nwaneri was born in Dallas, Texas, to Nigerian parents, who immigrated to the U.S. in the 1970s.
