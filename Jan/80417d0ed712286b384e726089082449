The Lagos State Police Command has transferred all out policemen attached to the Ajah Police Station. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Benjamin Hundeyin, made the disclosure in a series of tweet on Monday. Hundeyin was reacting to a report published by a news medium about Ajah policemen caught drinking on duty, a situation security experts claimed might be responsible for the recent killing of innocent Nigerians. “I can confirm that this publication has been overtaken by events. The new DPO Ajah, CSP Adolf Ogwu, had earlier in the week dismantled all the shanties around the police station. “In addition, the Commissioner of Police, Lagos State Command, CP Abiodun Alabi, has already effected the transfer out of all personnel of the division, with replacement from other divisions. This would fully materialise in a couple of days. The report had exposed how policemen attached to the Ajiwe Police Division, Ajah, Lagos State, regularly abuse alcohol which may be responsible for the increasing rate of extra-judicial killings by cops from the station as residents and business owners also observed the trend. It would be recalled that an Assistant Superintendent of Police, Drambi Vandi, who was attached to the station, had last week shot dead a pregnant lawyer, Bolanle Raheem. Two weeks before Raheem’s killing, an inspector attached to the same division, Imeh Johnson, had also shot dead another resident, Gafaru Buraimoh, who was on his way to buy fuel.
