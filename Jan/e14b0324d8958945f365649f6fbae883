Primate Elijah Ayodele, founder of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, has asked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to consider postponing next month’s general election. In a statement on Friday by his Media Aide, Oluwatosin Osho, Ayodele claimed that some unnamed persons have put plans into motion to sabotage the election if it holds on February 25, 2023. According to him, the electoral umpire must postpone the election to a later date to ensure a fair, credible, and violence-free exercise. ‘’If INEC doesn’t postpone the general elections, it will not hold in some places and it will lead to an inconclusive election. There are some people who will sabotage the election in those places,’’ he said. The cleric said the solution to Nigeria’s problem is restructuring, not elections. ‘’Nigeria cannot move forward without restructuring, God said that is the answer to Nigeria’s problems, not elections. If Nigeria doesn’t do restructuring in the coming dispensation, the country will collapse and what we don’t expect will happen.’’ ‘’If we want Nigeria to be united, restructuring is the answer. I also foresee a massive protest against the government in the coming dispensation if restructuring isn’t done.’’ ‘’None of the candidates can get the solution to the country, all the campaigns are lies. The best bet for the country is restructuring.’’
