Chimamanda Adichie, award-winning novelist, has expressed excitement at the presence of the Obi of Onitsha, Igwe Nnaemeka Alfred Achebe, in her hometown, Abba, Anambra State, during her coronation last Friday. Adichie, who shared photos of the Igwe on Monday, said, “I was delighted and deeply honoured to welcome the Obi of Onitsha, Igwe Nnaemeka Alfred Achebe, to Abba as I received the title of ‘Odeluwa’ from HRH Igwe LN Ezeh of Abba.” Adichie was given the title of Odeluwa, which loosely translates to a writer of global acclaim.
