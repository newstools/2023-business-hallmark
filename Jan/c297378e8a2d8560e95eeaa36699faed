You are the visitor that came in. Find your way out. “I will hold my family, polish it, sweep out all the debts, and then have a peaceful home again.” She also spoke on why she wouldn’t advise divorce in marriages, but separation instead, adding that God is not against separation. “God is not against separation. What God doesn’t want is divorce. “God is not saying we should not divorce because sometimes he does not know that we have violated – No,” she said. “Coming from a Christian background, we are not allowed to divorce. “If you pray and the man turns around to become something else, escape for dear life because it is only those who are alive that can tell the story. When you are dead, nobody can tell.”
