Adegboyega Oyetola, the immediate past governor of Osun State says God revealed to him that Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), will emerge victorious in the forthcoming 2023 general election. Oyetola said this while speaking at a prayer organised by the leadership of the APC to herald Oyetola’s return to the state since leaving office, held in Osogbo. The former governor charged the APC members to continue to meet on regular basis and avoid distraction, urging them to collect their Permanent Voter Cards and support Tinubu and his running mate, Kashim Shettima, at the presidential poll. “God has told me that he will do two things for us this year. We are going to retrieve our mandate and Asiwaju Bola Tinubu will become the president of Nigeria,” he said. “I know that you are scared by what happened but God knows how he does his plans. Everyone has his challenges, I only went to rest; you see I am fresh now. I served Osun wholeheartedly for four years without resting and God intentionally orchestrated my rest for a while. “God made me to govern Osun well. Let our mind be at rest. Nobody can scare us off this state. I want to implore us that we should work hard for the forthcoming election. It is very important to us,” Oyetola added.
