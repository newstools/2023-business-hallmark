The attackers were said to have invaded the secretariat early Thursday morning, killing three vigilantes who were guarding the complex. Ikenga Tochukwu, police spokesperson in Anambra, confirmed the development in a statement. The police spokesperson said several buildings in the council were also set ablaze by the attackers. He said one of the attackers was killed when security operatives, who responded to a distress call, engaged them in a firefight. “The operatives responding to a distress call at about 2:55 am today 12/1/2023 of an attack on Ihiala local government headquarters neutralise one of the attackers,” the statement reads. “The attackers had already murdered three vigilante operatives on duty, beheaded one, and set five buildings ablaze with IED and petrol bombs. “The joint force operatives engaged the arsonist/attackers and obstructed them from causing further damages while some escaped with bullet wounds.” Tochukwu said security operatives recovered weapons from the attackers, including two locally made IED launchers, seven undenoted IEDs, 40 pieces of live cartridges, 15 live 7.62mm AK47 ammunition, knives, and charms.
