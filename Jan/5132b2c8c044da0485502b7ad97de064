By Tumininu Ojelabi Hassan The Nigerian entertainment industry is unarguably one of the profitable industries in the country. A report from PwC projects that the fast-growing industry will generate $14.8 billion revenue in 2025. The industry revenue is expected to rise from $7.7 billion in 2021 to $9 billion in 2022, $10.7 billion in 2023, $12.6 billion in 2024 and $14.8 billion in 2025. 85% of this revenue will be generated by access to the Internet. According to PwC’s Global Entertainment and Media Outlook (2020-2024), Nigeria’s media and entertainment industry is one of the fastest growing creative industries in the world. It has the capability to become the country’s greatest export, with projected annual growth rate of 8.6% and a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.3% from 2018-2023. PwC indicates that in 2021, Nigeria’s film industry contributed 2.3% and about N239 billion ($660 million) to GDP and predicts that the industry will increase its export revenue earnings to over $1 billion. The motion picture and music recording industry exceeded 2020 estimated $806 million revenue contributing about N730 billion to the country’s GDP. The traditional TV and home video segment is the industry’s second-largest market. However, due to competition from other segments, its market share is projected to decline from 9% to 6% contrary to its expected rise from $692m in 2021 to $865m in 2025. Therefore, this led to the key players in the sector capitalizing on the internet wave.
