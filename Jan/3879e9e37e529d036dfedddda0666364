The funeral mass for late Pope emeritus Benedict XVI held St Peter’s Square in the Vatican City on Thursday. The mass was led by his successor of Pope Francis.  A mass choir also sang at the Mass for the first pontiff to have resigned since the Middle Ages. Benedict’s plain, cypress wood coffin sits in Vatican Square, which is packed with attendees. The Pope emeritus died on Saturday.
