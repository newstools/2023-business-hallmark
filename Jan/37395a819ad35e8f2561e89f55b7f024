The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), has voted to hike benchmark interest rate by 100 basis points to 17.5 per cent. The CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, disclosed this while reading the communiqu√© of the first MPC meeting of the year on Tuesday. This was the fifth time the CBN would increase the interest rate despite advice from manufacturers and some key stakeholders. The CBN said previous increases were beginning to yield results with the slight drop in the inflation rate recorded in December 2022. However, the CBN stressed that there was a need to keep tightening its fiscal policy. The CBN also retained the CRR at 32.5 per cent while the liquidity ratio was kept at 30 per cent. The apex bank had increased the MPR from 11.5 per cent earlier last year to 16.5 per cent across four consecutive rate hikes in 2022. Meanwhile, Emefiele maintained that the January 31st deadline for phasing out old naira notes remains sacrosanct.
