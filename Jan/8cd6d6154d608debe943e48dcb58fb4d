Brent crude on Thursday gained 0.69% to trade at $78.38 per barrel, while the American West Texas Intermediate (WTI), gained 0.56% to trade at $73.25 per barrel. This can be traced to the fact that Saudi Arabia, the worldâ€™s top crude oil exporter, cut the prices of all its crude grades loading for Asia The state-controlled Saudi Aramco slashed the official selling price (OSPs) of its flagship crude grade, Arab Light, to its main in Asia and Europe for February by $1.45 per barrel, setting the price at $1.80 a barrel above the Dubai/Oman benchmark. The premium to the Dubai/Oman average is the lowest since November 2021, but it was generally in line with expectations. The cut in oil prices appears to be a signal that demand remains sluggish as coronavirus cases in China surge. Crude also was restrained as equities fell and the dollar strengthened after a strong US labour report fuelled speculation that interest rates have more room to rise.
