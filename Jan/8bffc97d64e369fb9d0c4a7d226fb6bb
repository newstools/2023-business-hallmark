Everton FC have appointed Sean Dyche as their new manager. The former Brighton boss replaces Lampard who was recently sacked by the Toffees after a string of poor performances that left the club sitting in 19th position. Dyche signed a contract until June 2025 with the Toffees. On his appointment, Dyche said, “There is quality in this squad. But we have to make them shine”.
