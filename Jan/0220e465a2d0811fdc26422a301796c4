Rev. Fr. Ejike Mbaka, Spiritual Director, Adoration Ministry Enugu Nigeria (AMEN) has returned from monastery after eight months suspension. An excited crowd welcomed him on Wednesday. Mbaka had been at a monastery in the United States of America before now as part of sanctions against him by the Catholic Diocese of Enugu in 2022. The crowd that welcomed him started from the airport in Enugu with visuals on social media showing people lining the road to hail the popular cleric. Mbaka was sent to the monastery last year. On June 3, 2022 the Catholic Diocese of Enugu banned him from commenting on political issues after activities in the ministry were suspended. Upon reopening, the Church turned the ministry into Chaplaincy to monitor the excesses in the ministry. In October 2022, the Catholic Bishop of Enugu Diocese, Most Rev. Callistus Onaga, had transferred Mbaka from chaplaincy to the monastery. Consequently, Rev. Fr. Anthony Amadi was named to replace him (Mbaka) as the new chaplain of the Adoration Ministry Chaplaincy. More subsequentlyâ€¦
