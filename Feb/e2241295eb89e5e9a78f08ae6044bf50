Analysts believe that these are impressive performances given the high level of volatility in the operating environment. Nigeria’s economy has in most of the past seven years been struggling, giving out discouraging signals to would -be investors in the country. This has become a source of concern to the discerning especially economic experts whose expectations are not met. Throughout this year the impressions of the Bretton Woods institutions do not seem to see signs of improvements in the economic policies for positive growth, but that of gloom and uncertainty. This is despite their projections that the economic will grow by over 3 per cent. Giving credence to this story is the recent down grading of Nigeria and banks by the
international rating agency, Moodys, on the premise of weak macro-economic environment. Details according to Moody’s is that the downgrade of the long-term ratings of nine Nigerian banks are based on two factors, the weakening of operating environment as captured by Moody’s lowering of its Macro Profile for Nigeria to ‘Very Weak’ from ‘very weak +’ and the connection with the sovereign’s weakened creditworthiness and the banks’ balance sheets, given banks’ holdings of sovereign debt securities. The banks affected here include; Access Bank Plc, Zenith Bank Plc, First Bank of Nigeria Limited, United Bank for Africa Plc and Guaranty Trust Bank Limited. Others are Union Bank of Nigeria plc, Fidelity Bank Plc, FCMB (First City Monument Bank) Limited and Sterling Bank Plc. Critically, recent statistics reveal that the rate of unemployment, one of the highest in the world is 40%. At the same time, the underemployment rate stood at 25%; even as inflation, which is hitting the roof top at 21.6, though tempered from 22 percent, remains the highest point in the last seven years. At the same time, Diaspora remittances which recorded $23billion before the covid -19 year is still down. Also remarkable is the country’s heavy debt burden at N44trillion ($103b)and expected to continue to hit N77trillion if the N21trillion CBN ways and means to FG is securitised; of the budget of N21trillion budget deficit stood at N12 trillion as over 80 per cent of revenues is used to service debt. More worrisome is that the country has set new borrowing limit from 25 per cent of GDP to 40 per cent of the GDP. This was contained in the Medium Term Debt Strategy. The major revenue earner for the country, crude oil price, which has hit $75 pbd and above presently still fluctuates. Insecurity has not only hobbled agriculture, many parts of Northern Nigeria have been taken over by bandits such that not much business activities can subsist. The World Bank just noted that Nigeria’s revenue to GDP ratio hovered between five and six per cent last year and remains the lowest in the world. These days almost everybody is aware that Nigeria parades the most poverty stricken people in the world, competing with India. The Naira which sold at N220/$ in June 15, 2015 has depreciated by 300 per cent to N735/$ as at yesterday Saturday 4, 2022.
