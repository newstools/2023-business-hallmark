Military police in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, have arrested a man dressed as a 7ft penis, after women complained that he was harassing them. The police arrested the man costumed as a giant phallus in the city centre on Sunday for ‘acting suspiciously’. The arrest photo shows a man wearing a giant manhood costume and flip-flops being held by an officer. According to the Daily Mail on Wednesday, carnival goers in the city told police that he had been using his costume to chase women in the city’s parades.
