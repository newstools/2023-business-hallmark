Adakole Ijogi, a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has said that the Middle Belt Forum has directed the people of the area to vote for Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party. Though a PDP member, Ijogi said he would vote for Obi on February 25, while expressing doubt about on the chances of his party’s flag bearer, Atiku Abubakar. Speaking on Channels Television’s The 2023 Verdict on Wednesday, Ijogi said, “The leadership of the Middle Belt Forum has resolved that for the presidential election, it is not about party this time around, it’s about candidate. “So, the Middle Belt people have been directed to vote for former governor, Peter Obi of the Labour Party for only the presidential election. Then in other elections they have been advised to vote for the PDP. So, we will be voting for Obi.” The leadership of the Middle Belt Forum alongside other regional groups like Afenifere, Ohanaeze Ndigbo and Pan Niger Delta Forum had earlier in February endorsed Obi. Ijogi, who is a political economist, claimed that about 50% of PDP members would not be voting for Atiku, saying that they will vote for Obi because he stands out among the other candidates. According to him, the decision of the Middlebelt Forum concerning the 2023 presidential election transcends political party and that the people have gone through a whole lot in the last few years, including killings, kidnappings among others. Ijogi noted that Obi has made successful inroads in the Middle Belt and would get the votes which hitherto went to the PDP. The Middle Belt in Nigeria include Benue, Taraba, Kogi, Kwara, amongst others. Already, Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom has endorsed Obi for President.
