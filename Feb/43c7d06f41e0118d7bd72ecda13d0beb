Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the director general of the World Trade Organization, has lamented the non arrival of staff of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) at her polling unit in Abia State. The former Finance Minister said she had been waiting for over an hour, along with several villagers at her ward, but no sign of INEC staff yet. “Waiting to vote at my polling station in Umuda Isingwu village Umuahia , Abia state,” she said. “I have been waiting one hour. Many villagers have been here since 7 am. It is 11.23 am now. Where are the INEC officers??” Waiting to vote at my polling station in Umuda Isingwu village Umuahia , Abia state.
