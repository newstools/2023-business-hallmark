Olusesan Laoye Dr. Adeniran Tella, the Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Oyo State, says the Commission will only engage vehicles from credible individuals in the state for the movement of materials in the coming elections. Adeniran who spoke while answering question on whether the commission is going to engage the Oyo State Park Managers for the movement of materials during the election at the Nigerian Union of Journalists Correspondents Chapel’s platform “Speak Out” in Ibadan, said the commission will engage good vehicles from credible individuals. He noted that such vehicles would have been satisfied as road worthy by the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC). He said the commission has identified some local governments in the state as security flashpoints and that adequate security measures have been taken to forestall breakdown of law and order. According to him, the Commission has got mobilisation for the ad-hoc staff being engaged for the Saturday election, promising that they will be adequately remunerated before embarking on the election exercise. Adeniran called on the residents of the state to fully participate in the election saying their safety is guaranteed as all efforts have been made to provide for their security. He said sustenance of democracy is the duty of all Nigerians and not that of INEC alone. He also said that security would be provided at the border towns with other states during the election to forestall movement of miscreants from the neighbouring states into Oyo State.
