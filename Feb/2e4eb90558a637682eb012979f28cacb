The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has has announced the postponement of senatorial election in Enugu East, following the killing of Oyibo Chukwu, the Labour Party senatorial candidate. INEC Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu made this known at a media briefing on Friday in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory. According to him, the election in the senatorial district earlier slated for Saturday, February 25, 2023, has been moved to March 11, 2023. Yakubu said the postponement in the district which covers four local government areas became necessary with the murder of Mr. Chukwu. He said the Labour Party reached out to the electoral body to convey its intention to provide a replacement and go ahead with the poll at the new date. Chukwu and his personal assistant were assassinated on Wednesday when hoodlums attacked them and set their vehicle ablaze in the Eke-Otu Amechi-Awkunanaw area of Enugu. Meanwhile, the INEC chairman reassured that Nigeria’s 2023 presidential election will hold on February 25, tomorrow, as scheduled. His assurances come a few hours before the presidential poll slated for Saturday, February 25, 2023. “Generally speaking, the situation is calm in the country as far as our preparation is concerned,” Yakubu said. According to him, there has been no incident of insecurity involving the personnel and materials deployed by the commission. “Voter enthusiasm is high and so too is our determination to conduct credible elections. Tomorrow is election day,” he declared. By his statement, the electoral chief ruled out any postponement which had consistently characterised Nigeria’s general elections since 2011 but 12am on Saturday is still a long time for any last-minute development. Historically, INEC rescheduled the 2011, 2015 and 2019 general elections due to security, logistics and operational challenges.
