Nedu Wazobia, a popular on-air personality, has argued that the saying ‘No finance, No Romance’ is true especially in Nigeria, as according to him, there is no romance without finance in the country. Nedu said that in Nigeria things have gotten to the point where you couldn’t have love without having money, adding that if a man wanted to talk to a lady, he must have money except he is deceiving himself. Nedu who made this known in an audio-video podcast on Monday, explained that without finance there can be no romance. “But true, true, no finance… True, true, no finance, no romance. Make we no deceive ourselves. It has got to a point where you no fit do love for Nigeria without money,” he said. “For example, but it’s bad, I no go lie give you.
