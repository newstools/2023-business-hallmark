Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom, has displayed his ballot paper after voting for Peter Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP). Ortom, a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), had earlier endorsed Obi against Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the PDP. He is also part of a five-member group of PDP governors at loggerheads with the national leadership of the party. The governor voted for Obi at his polling unit in Tse-Ortom, Mzondu ward, Guma LGA of the state on Saturday. Ortom, who is contesting for Benue north-west senatorial seat, had earlier said he was ready to sacrifice his senatorial bid for the victory of the LP candidate.
