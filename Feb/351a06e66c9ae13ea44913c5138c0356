Mr. Peter Obi, Labour Party presidential candidate, is ahead of his counterpart in the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu with over 1,000 votes in 17 local government areas (LGAs) in Lagos State. As of 07:30am on Monday, Obi polled 448,878 while Tinubu scored 447,187 votes in 17 local government areas in Lagos. The figures are according to results collated by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the February 25 presidential election in Lagos. INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner, Olusegun Agbaje opened the floor at the state collation centre in the Yaba area of the state on Sunday and the collation ran until midnight on Monday. The results for 17 of the state’s 20 LGAs presented by 3:40 am on Monday including Lagos Mainland, Ikorodu, Epe, Ibeju-Lekki, Lagos Island, Badagry, Agege, Ikeja, Shomolu, Kosofe, Amuwo Odofin, Eti Osa, Surulere, Apapa, Ifako Ijaiye, Ajeromi, Oshodi Isolo. Results presented for Mushin LGA have yet to get cleared by the state collation officer as they are being contested by the Inter-party Advisory Committee (IPAC) and thus had yet to be signed by most party agents. Meanwhile, Ojo and Alimosho are the only two LGAs left to be announced. The REC in the state is expected to reconvene later on Monday for the final collation of results. Of the 87, 209,007 Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) collected nationwide for the election, 6,214,970 PVCs were collected in Lagos. This is closely followed by Kano with 5,594,193, and Kaduna with 4,164, 473. See results: Lagos Mainland LGA
