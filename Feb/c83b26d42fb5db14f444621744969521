Simon Ekpa, a self-acclaimed follower of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has been released by the police in Finland after about five hours of questioning. Ekpa was arrested by police at his residence in Lahti, Finland, on Thursday. He was picked up by the police just before he was to grant a newspaper interview, a Finland-based newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (HS), reported. The platform also published a picture showing Ekpa being escorted by police officers at his residence. Hours later, HS reported that the Finland-based Biafra agitator had been released by the police after hours of questioning. Although Tommi Reen, an officer with the Central Criminal Police, did not state the identity of the suspect in custody, he confirmed the raid to HS. Reen, however, said the suspect was released after a few hours of questioning, adding that investigation is ongoing. “The person being questioned today is suspected of a crime. We will return to the title on Friday,” Reen was quoted as saying. Recently, Ekpa, who leads IPOB Autopilot, a breakaway faction of the group, declared that there will be no elections in the Southeast zone of Nigeria. But the IPOB leadership has since disowned him and insisted that people of the zone should go and vote during the elections. Aside from the threat to elections, Ekpa insisted that people of the Southeast region must observe sit-at-home every Monday to protest the detention of Kanu. The sit-at-home order is often violently enforced by gunmen loyal to him, which has led to destruction of lives and property.
