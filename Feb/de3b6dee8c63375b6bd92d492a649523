The Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to suspend the collation of presidential election results in national interest to avoid anarchy. Ikenga Ugochinyere, the spokesperson of CUPP and member-elect, Ikenga Ugochinyere, made the call in a statement titled, “Why ongoing collation of presidential election results are unconstitutional and a possible invitation to anarchy that must be averted now by immediate halt.” Describing the process as unconstitutional, the opposition parties said the ongoing collation of results should be stopped in view of the compromise of the process and violation of the provision of the Electoral Act. The coalition alleged that the results being collated was not transmitted directly from polling units “but cooked by some rouge governors.” Ugochinyere, the Peoples Democratic Party, House of Representatives member-elect for Ideato North/South Federal Constituency in Imo State, therefore warned that collation should be stopped to prevent invitation to anarchy and burning down of Nigeria. He said, “The ongoing collation of presidential election results are unconstitutional and a possible invitation to anarchy that must be averted now by immediate halt. As a constitutional lawyer, foremost advocate for credible election and Spokesman of CUPP, I have come to the conclusion to advise that in the national interest that collation of presidential election results be halted in view of compromise and violation of provision of section 64(4) of the Electoral Act. “Clearly, the results being collated were not transmitted directly from the polling units but cooked by rogue governors who were the same elements behind the Omuma magic compromise of the voters register and should be stopped before this illegality throws Nigeria into national confusion.”
