The All Progressives Congress (APC) has suspended the Senate Chief Whip, Orji Uzor Kalu (Abia North) over alleged anti-party activities and other offenses. The ruling party in a letter conveying Kanu’s suspension, said it was with immediate effect. Kalu had been at loggerheads with the leadership and members of Abia APC over allegations that the former Abia governor had been undermining and sabotaging the party in the state. According to the letter dated February 21, Kalu was suspended for “acts of disobedience and gross anti-party activities”. The letter was signed by the Chairman of the Disciplinary Committee, Paul Nwabuisi; State Secretary, Chief Chidi Avajah, and the State Chairman, Dr. Kingsley Ononogbu. It noted that Kalu, who had been at loggerheads with many APC chieftains in Abia, “has remained unrepentant and without remorse despite several warnings.” APC explained that Kalu’s suspension came after “thorough investigations and recommendations of the Disciplinary Committee set up by the Igbere Ward A in Bende Local Government of Abia State.” The Abia APC leadership further stated that Kalu’s suspension was in consonance with Article 21B(i-v) of the APC Constitution, which he violated. The letter read in part: “You are hereby suspended from the All Progressives Congress (APC).” The former governor has been accused of working against the APC governorship candidate, Chief Ikechi Emenike. He has also been accused of promoting the interests of the Action Peoples Party(APP), where his younger brother, Mascot Uzor Kalu, is the governorship candidate.
