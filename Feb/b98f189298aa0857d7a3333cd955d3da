Mr. Simon Ekpa, leader of a faction of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) known as IPOB Autopilot, has been arrested by authorities in Finland, following appeals by the Nigerian government. Ekpa was reportedly arrested by Finnish police on Thursday, months after calls for his arrest by Nigerians, especially in the Southeast geopolitical zone, were ignored. Ekpa was picked up from his Apartment in Lahti region of Finland by officers from the Finnish Central Criminal Police on Thursday morning, though details of his arrest were still sketchy at the time of filing this report. Ekpa, a self acclaimed follower of Nnamdi Kanu, IPOB leader, has been using his social media accounts to issue countless sit-at-home orders and incite violence in the Southeast of Nigeria. He had recently declared that there would be no election in the Southeast zone, and in the lead up to the election gunmen suspected to be loyal to him have been attacking and killing political figures in the zone, as well as destroying offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission, police stations and attacking security agents.
