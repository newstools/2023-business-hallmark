Senate Chief Whip, Orji Uzor Kalu, has dismissed report of his suspension by the All Progressives Congress (APC), insisting that only the national working committee can suspend him from the party. Recall that the APC in Abia State had in a letter signed by the Chairman of its Disciplinary Committee, Paul Nwabuisi; State Secretary, Chief Chidi Avajah, and the State Chairman, Dr. Kingsley Ononogbu, announced the suspension of the former governor over anti party activities. However, Kalu in a statement posted via his Twitter page on Friday, dismissed the report as false. “I am not worried when politicians who have lost relevance resort to propaganda and blackmail,” he said. “I am only worried when respected media houses become agents of mischief. It is for this kind of mischief that the federal government is emphasizing on media regulations. Vanguard’s reported news on my suspension from the APC is highly unprofessional and embarrassing to the media house. “I understand that the opposition’s only strategy is propaganda but “Vanguard” accepting to be used for such news shows another height of ignorance. “Constitutionally, it is only the NWC and NEC of a party that has the right to suspend a sitting Senator. Vanguard has publicly taken political positions and it’s a great shame to feed the public with lies.”
