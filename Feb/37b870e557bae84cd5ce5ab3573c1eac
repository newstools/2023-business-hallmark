Kylian Mbappe, French star, says he is hopeful that his Paris Saint-Germain will beat Bayern Munich in the second leg of their UEFA Champions League round of 16 fixture on March 8 at the Allianz Arena. Bayern Munich defeated the Parisians 1-0 in the first leg at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday February 14 courtesy of a goal by Kingsley Coman in the 53rd minute. Mbappe was substituted in the game for Carlos Soler in the 57th minute but was unable to score for the hosts though he had two goals ruled out for offside. He was quoted by Football Daily to have expressed the belief tha there is a chance to overcome Bayern Munich as the full squad regains fitness. “I was unable to change the result but now there are reasons for hope because we are starting to recover our whole team, we were decimated by injuries,” he was quoted Mbappe as saying Mbappe is the current topscorer in the 2022/23 Champions League with seven goals in seven games for Paris Saint-Germain so far.
