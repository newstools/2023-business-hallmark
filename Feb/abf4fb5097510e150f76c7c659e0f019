Presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, has condemned the killing of the party’s senatorial candidate for Enugu East Senatorial District, Oyibo Chukwu. The former governor of Anambra State also condoled with the grieving family. He said this via his Instagram account on Thursday. Gunmen had killed and burnt the LP senatorial candidate with five supporters who were with him inside his car in Enugu on Wednesday night. Reacting to the development, Obi wrote, “I received with deep shock and sadness, the news of the painful killing of Barr Oyibo Chukwu, the Senatorial Candidate of the Labour Party, for Enugu East Senatorial Zone. “ I strongly condemn the killing of Barr Chukwu in all its entirety. “Human lives must remain precious, irrespective of political affiliation. The mindless bloodletting that occurs in the nation is beyond depressing. We must not continue to toe this dangerous path. “Enough of the killings, now is time for healing. I sincerely condole with the bereaved family, the Enugu East Senatorial Zone and our dear Labour Party family, for this painful loss. I call on the law enforcement agents to fish out and bring to book, the perpetrators of this crime, and ensure that Nigerians freely exercise their civic duties without intimidation.”
