Dario Monteiro, the coach of Mozambique’s Under 20 team, says his side will go all out for a win in their final Group A game against the Flying Eagles of Nigeria. Young Os Mambas have picked just one point from their opening two games, meaning that their final group game against Nigeria is a make or break encounter. Monteiro’s charges will have to beat the Flying Eagles of Nigeria in their last group match in Ismailia to qualify to the knockout stage of the tournament. “We are now preparing to face Nigeria on Saturday. The match is not easy, but we are holding on to our chance to rise and we will fight for victory. It is now clear, either we win or we return to our country,” Monteiro told journalists at his post-match conference. “We performed well in the first half and prevented Senegal from scoring any goal. We also took the initiative to attack and tried to score, but we did not take advantage of the opportunity. “The situation was completely different in the second half, and the team could not continue to resist the Senegal attack. We have to admit that the Senegal national team is very strong and we have more time to reach their level.”
