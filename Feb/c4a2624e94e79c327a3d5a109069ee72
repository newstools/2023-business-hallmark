The FGN bond market has grown significantly in recent years, with a wide range of maturities and attractive yields for investors. “Overall, the results of the February 2023 FGN bond auction highlight the continued strong demand for FGN bonds and the government’s commitment to meeting its funding needs through the capital markets.”
